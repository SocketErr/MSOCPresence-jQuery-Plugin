Microsoft Office Communicator Presence jQuery Plugin
https://github.com/SocketErr/MSOCPresence-jQuery-Plugin


This jQuery plugin adds Microsoft Office Communicator presence awareness to elements.


NOTE:
This plugin utilizes the "Name.NameCtrl" ActiveX control.  It requires that Microsoft
Office Communicator be installed, can only run in Internet Explorer, and only shows
presence information when served from a "trusted" site.  The main audience for a
plugin like this are those developing for an intranet that uses the MS Office suite
of collaboration tools. 

If the user's environment does NOT meet the aforementioned requirements he/she will
simply not see presence information.  This plugin should not interfere with other
functionality within the page.

Usage

     This plugin will automatically apply presence information once the document has been
     fully loaded.
 
     NOTE:  
       The OOUI widget can be disabled by setting "$.msocpresence.displayOOUI" to false

* The following CSS classes will also need to be defined:

- status-online
- status-offline
- status-away
- status-busy
- status-brb
- status-phone
- status-lunch
